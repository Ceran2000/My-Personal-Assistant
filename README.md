# My Personal Assistant

## Description

"My Personal Assistant" is an Android mobile application designed for organizing daily tasks by creating notes and to-do lists. The application allows users to quickly create, edit, and delete notes and to-do lists, as well as synchronize data across different devices using Firebase Cloud Firestore. The project is written in Kotlin and utilizes modern tools such as Jetpack Compose for building the user interface, Hilt for dependency injection, and Lottie library for handling animations.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Firebase**: Cloud Firestore for data storage and Authentication module for user authentication.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern UI toolkit for Android applications, enabling declarative UI creation. Utilizes **Material Design 3** principles for a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Navigation**: Android Jetpack's Navigation component for handling navigation between different screens within the app.
- **Hilt**: A dependency injection library for Android applications. It simplifies managing components and providing them with dependencies.
- **Lottie**: A library for handling animations, allowing integration with animations created in JSON format.

## Future Plans

Some future plans for the development of the project:

- **Collaborative Note and List Creation**: Implementing a system for collaborative note and list creation through invitation-based sharing.
- **Database Technology Transition**: Transitioning to a different remote database technology to improve scalability, performance, or other factors.
- **Local Database Implementation**: Adding support for a local database to enable offline access and improve performance.
- **Integration with Calendar**: Adding integration with calendar services to allow users to schedule tasks and events directly from the app.
- **Task Reminders and Notifications**: Implementing reminders and notifications for tasks and events to help users stay organized and on track.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Expanding the project to support other platforms such as iOS or web browsers to reach a wider audience.
